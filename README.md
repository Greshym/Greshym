### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Boris Vallantin, youn web developper from Rueil-Malmaison, France.

I recelty graduated from [<img src="https://github.com/Greshym/Greshym/blob/main/img/CaptureO'ClockLogo.PNG" height="24em" align="center" title="O'Clock"/>](https://oclock.io/), where i scpecifyed myself in back-programming. But this is not all I ever participated to, so, where did I go ..?

- I'll be quick for the begining. First, I wanted to own my own pastry shop, so I learned everything about food in [<img src="https://github.com/Greshym/Greshym/blob/main/img/CaptureFerrandiLogo.PNG" height="24em" align="center" title="Ferrandi"/>](https://www.ferrandi-paris.fr/)
, and worked at [<img src="https://github.com/Greshym/Greshym/blob/main/img/CaretteLogo.PNG" height="24em" align="center" title="Carette"/>](https://paris-carette.fr/) and [<img src="https://github.com/Greshym/Greshym/blob/main/img/Porel&ChabotLogo.PNG" height="24em" align="center" title="Potel & Chabot"/>](https://poteletchabot.com/) among others. It did teach me a lot about hard-working.
- I then realised I needed a big turn in my life, and since I did not know either I had to go left or right, I went to [<img src="https://github.com/Greshym/Greshym/blob/main/img/CaptureIFFEuropeLogo.PNG" height="24em" align="center" title="IFF Europe"/>](https://www.iffeurope.fr/)
- This is when I started getting really interested in programming, I went by [<img src="https://github.com/Greshym/Greshym/blob/main/img/TheHackingProjectLogo.PNG" height="24em" align="center" title="The Hacking Project"/>](https://www.thehackingproject.org/), I took [<img src="https://github.com/Greshym/Greshym/blob/main/img/OpenclassroomsLogo.PNG" height="24em" align="center" title="Openclassroom"/>](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/) 's C classes, and participated [<img src="https://github.com/Greshym/Greshym/blob/main/img/42Logo.PNG" height="28em" align="center" title="42"/>](https://42.fr/)'s pool, before finally getting to O'clock.

## On my Way there, I learned

- A bit of [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Ruby-blue"/>](https://www.ruby-lang.org/fr/), [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Ruby-blue"/>](https://unity.com/fr)
- A lot more of [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-C-blue"/>](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(langage)), [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-JS-blue"/>](https://www.javascript.com/), [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Bash-blue"/>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)), [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-MySQL-blue"/>](https://www.mysql.com/fr/)
- A whole lot moe about [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/This%20thing-Life-ff69b4"/>](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_:_Origine_inconnue)

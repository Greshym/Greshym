### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Boris Vallantin, youn web developper from Rueil-Malmaison, France.

I recelty graduated from [<img src="https://github.com/Greshym/Greshym/blob/main/img/CaptureO'ClockLogo.PNG" height="24em" align="center" title="O'Clock"/>](https://oclock.io/), where i scpecifyed myself in back-programming. But this is not all I ever participated to, so, where did I go ..?

- I'll be quick for the begining. First, I wanted to own my own pastry shop, so I learned everything about food in [<img src="">]
, and worked at [] and [] among others. It did teach me a lot about hard-working.
- I then realised I needed a big turn in my life, and since I did not know either I had to go left or right, I went to []
- This is when I started getting really interested in programming, i went by [], I took [open classroom's c classes], and participated [42's pool session], before finally getting to O'clock.

## On my Way there, I learned

- A bit of ruby, Unity
- A lot more of C, javascript, bash, mySQL
- A whole lot moe about life

## This part is about my contact and where you can find me
